Computing order price with discounts  

A retail store sells a variety of goods and can offer various types of discount, for selected customers, articles, or per order.   
The following types of discount could be available:
A fixed discount, such as 5%, regardless of the article or the quantity that is purchased.  
A volume discount, such as 10%, for each article when buying more than a particular quantity of that article.  
A price discount per total order of an article, that is, a discount for an article when a customer buys a quantity of that article so that the total cost exceeds a particular amount.   
For instance, a 15% discount for an article when the total cost of that article exceeds $100. If the article costs $5, and the customer buys 30 units, the total cost is $150; therefore, a 15% discount applies to the order of that article.
A price discount per entire order (regardless what articles and in which quantity they were ordered).
