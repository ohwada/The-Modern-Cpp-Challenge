Validating passwords  

Write a program that validates password strength based on predefined rules, which may then be selected in various combinations. At a minimum, every password must meet a minimum length requirement. In addition, other rules could be enforced, such as the presence of at least one symbol, digit, uppercase and lowercase letter, and so on.
