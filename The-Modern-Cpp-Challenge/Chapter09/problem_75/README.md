Serializing data to JSON  

Write a program that can serialize a list of movies, as defined for the previous problems, to a JSON file.   
Each movie has a numerical identifier, title, release year, length in minutes, a list of directors, a list of writers, and a list of casting roles with actor name and character name.   
The following is an example of the expected JSON format:

### Modern Style:  
c++17 std::optional
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional

### Require:  
nlohmann-json  
https://github.com/nlohmann/json  

### Buid and Run:  
% cd build  
% cmake ..  
% make  

% ./problem_75
