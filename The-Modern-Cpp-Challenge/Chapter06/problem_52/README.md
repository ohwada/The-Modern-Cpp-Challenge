===============

Generating all the permutations of a string  

Write a function that, prints on the console all the possible permutations of a given string.   
You should provide two versions of this function: one that uses recursion, and one that does not.


### Modern Style:  
none

### Buid and Run:  
% cd build  
% cmake ..  
% make  

% ./problem_52 
> non-recursive version
> aimn
> ainm
