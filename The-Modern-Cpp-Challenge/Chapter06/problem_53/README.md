Average rating of movies  

Write a program that calculates and prints the average rating of a list of movies.   
Each movie has a list of ratings from 1 to 10 (where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest rating).   
In order to compute the rating, you must remove 5% of the highest and lowest ratings before computing their average.   The result must be displayed with a single decimal point.
