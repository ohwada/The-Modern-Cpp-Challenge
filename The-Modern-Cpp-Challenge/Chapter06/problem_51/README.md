Transforming a list of phone numbers

Write a function that, given a list of phone numbers, transforms them so they all start with a specified phone country code, preceded by the + sign.   
Any whitespaces from a phone number should also be removed.   
The following is a list of input and output examples:

7555 123456 => +447555123456


### Modern Style:  
c++14 std::cbegin
