problem_12  
===============

Largest Collatz sequence   

Write a program that determines and prints which number up to 1 million produces the longest Collatz sequence and what its length is.


Collatz conjecture:

### Modern Style:  
 c++11 : List-initialization 
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/list_initialization  

> data 
>   {
>      { 10ULL, 9ULL, 19 },
 

### Buid and Run:  
% cd build  
% cmake ..  
% make  

% ./problem_12  
>  less than      : 10  
> starting number: 9  
> sequence length: 19  
> less than      : 100  
> starting number: 97  
> sequence length: 118  


### Rewrite in C  
- pro12.c  
% make pro12  
% bin/pro12
